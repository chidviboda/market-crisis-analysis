# Data Analytics Project – Market Crisis Correlations & CAPM Betas  

This repository contains a Python-based analysis of S&P 500 stock correlations and CAPM betas during crisis vs. non-crisis periods.  

## Overview
- **Goal:** Measure how correlations and betas behave in different market conditions.
- **Key Findings:**  
  - Average correlation increased from 0.46 (non-crisis) to 0.62 (crisis).  
  - Average CAPM beta increased from 1.03 (non-crisis) to 1.07 (crisis).  
- **Skills Demonstrated:**  
  - Data wrangling with pandas & NumPy  
  - Financial analytics (correlation, CAPM beta)  
  - Data visualization with Matplotlib  
  - Risk and portfolio insights for crisis management  

## Files
- **Data Analytics Project 2.ipynb** – Full Jupyter notebook with Python code, graphs, and calculations.  
- **Data Analytics Project 2.docx** – Written report summarizing methodology, findings, and recommendations.  

## Plots & Outputs
